      I’m a Computer Science student and web developer, passionate about tech since I was a kid. I’m enthusiastic about
      programming in general. When I’m not coding, I’m usually watching programming talks on YouTube, binging videos
      from Primeagen, or watching stuff about hardware, gaming, and benchmarks. This blog is my space to share what I’m
      learning, my interests, and to practice writing better along the way.
